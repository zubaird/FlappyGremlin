FlappyGremlin
=============

This is a fun iOS game I made in Ruby to test what's possible for a mobile developer using Ruby.
The game runs extremely smooth on an iPhone 5 and iPhone 4 -  I have not tested it on any other device.

The Game: 
Catch as many bananas as you can while hopping off the wing of an airplane!

Controls:
<-- Tap to the left of the Gremlin to hop left.
--> Tap to the right of the Gremlin to hop right.
^   Tap right above the Gremlin to hop straight up.

Here are the rules of this friendly game:

1. Don't fall off the side. 
2. Don't jump too high.  
3. Don't miss a banana!

I incorporated Box2D physics engine, RubyMotion and JoyBox.  

Features score keeping, objects in game loop, directional control via touch placement, physics(gravity, friction, density, angular momentum), gremlins and bananas.
