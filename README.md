FlappyGremlin
=============

This is a fun iOS game I made in Ruby to test what's possible for a mobile developer using Ruby.
The game runs extremely smooth on an iPhone 5 and iPhone 4 -  I have not tested it on any other device.

The Game: 
Catch the bananas while hopping off the wing of an airplane!

Controls:
<-- Tap to the left of the Gremlin to hop left.
--> Tap to the right of the Gremlin to hop right.
^   Tap right above the Gremlin to hop straight up.

Here are the rules of this friendly game:

1. Fall off the side? - you die.  
2. Jump too high? - you die.  
3. Miss a banana? - you die.
4. Quit out of frustration? - you win.

I incorporated Box2D physics engine, RubyMotion and JoyBox.  

Features score keeping, objects in game loop, directional control via touch placement, physics(gravity, friction, density, angular momentum), gremlins and bananas.
